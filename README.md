# Claude Agents

Specialized Claude Code agents for software development workflows - AI-native development automation.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of battle-tested Claude Code agents designed to streamline software development workflows. These agents enable AI-native development practices by automating routine tasks, enforcing quality standards, and maintaining consistency across your codebase.

## What are Claude Code Agents?

Claude Code agents are specialized AI assistants that run within the Claude Code environment. Each agent is designed for a specific task (testing, code review, documentation, etc.) and comes with:

- **Focused expertise** in a particular domain
- **Pre-defined tools** and capabilities
- **Structured workflows** for consistent results
- **Integration patterns** for working together

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed
- A codebase you want to apply these agents to

### Basic Setup

1. **Copy agents to your project:**

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/atrim-ai/claude-agents.git

# Copy agents to your project's .claude/agents directory
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude/agents
cp claude-agents/agents/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/agents/
```

2. **Start using agents in Claude Code:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude-code
```

3. **Invoke an agent:**

```
Use the testing-agent to run comprehensive tests
```

### Advanced Setup

For project-specific customization, you can modify the agent files in your `.claude/agents/` directory. Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter defining its capabilities and behavior.

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests

```
Use the testing-agent to validate infrastructure and execute the test suite
```

### Code Review Before Commit

```
Use the code-review-agent to review recent changes for quality and conventions
```

### Refactoring Code

```
Use the refactoring-specialist to analyze and refactor the authentication module
```

### Creating a Pull Request

```
Use the pr-creation-agent to organize screenshots and create a comprehensive PR
```

### Analyzing Code Duplication

```
Use the dryness-agent to scan for code duplication and suggest refactoring opportunities
```

### UI Testing with Diagnostics

```
Use the ui-review-agent to run e2e tests and analyze UI issues
```

## Agent Workflows

Agents can work together in orchestrated workflows:

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Feature implementation** ‚Üí manual development or `code-implementation-planning-agent`
2. **Periodic validation** ‚Üí `testing-agent`
3. **Pre-commit review** ‚Üí `code-review-agent`
4. **Documentation sync** ‚Üí `code-to-docs-sync-agent`
5. **PR creation** ‚Üí `pr-creation-agent` (after `pnpm typecheck:all` and `pnpm lint`)

### Quality Assurance Workflow

1. `testing-agent` ‚Üí comprehensive test validation
2. `ui-review-agent` ‚Üí UI testing with diagnostic capture (for UI changes)
3. `code-review-agent` ‚Üí quality and convention check
4. `code-to-docs-sync-agent` ‚Üí documentation alignment
5. Ready for commit/PR

### Refactoring Workflow

1. `dryness-agent` ‚Üí identify duplication and refactoring opportunities
2. `refactoring-specialist` ‚Üí apply safe transformations
3. `testing-agent` ‚Üí verify behavior preservation
4. `code-review-agent` ‚Üí validate improvements

## Customization

Each agent can be customized for your project's specific needs by editing the markdown files in `.claude/agents/`. Key customization points:

- **Tools**: Specify which Claude Code tools the agent can use
- **Model**: Specify which Claude model to use (e.g., `claude-3-opus-4-20250805`)
- **Behavior**: Modify the agent's instructions and workflow
- **Integration**: Add project-specific commands and validation

## Best Practices

1. **Use agents proactively**: Don't wait for problems - agents can prevent issues
2. **Combine agents**: Orchestrate multiple agents for complex workflows
3. **Customize for your stack**: Adapt agents to your technology choices
4. **Maintain consistency**: Use agents regularly to maintain code quality
5. **Trust but verify**: Agents are powerful but review their outputs
